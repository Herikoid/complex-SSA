Singular spectrum analysis (SSA) is a non-parametric method 
for the decomposition of time series into the sum of 
interpreted components, such as trend, periodicals and noise. 
The extension of SSA to the complex case is called CSSA. 
CSSA method is not robust (unstable to outliers) according
to that the construction of robust modifications of CSSA
was described. The example with demonstration of modifications
usage was considered. Modifications were implemented in the R.
Theoretical comparison of CSSA and SSA applied by
separately to the real and imaginary parts was provided.
Comparison was based on the first order (in terms of 
perturbation magnitude) of the signal estimation error. 
First order and full errors were numerically compared.
For a constant signal with outlier explicit formulas for
first order error were recieved.
