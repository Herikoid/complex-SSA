  abstract = {This paper is devoted to the theoretical investigation of the robustness of singular spectrum analysis (SSA) if the length N of a time series tends to infinity. The latter condition distinguishes the work from quite a lot of works on the robustness of SSA. Here, we used a version of the SSA method that is intended for extraction of the signal from the sum of the signal and noise. Therefore, taking the series corresponding to the available outliers as noise, we can obtain uniform estimates for the signal-approximation errors at large N. If these estimates tend to zero as N → ∞, then the method is robust. Several examples of this approach for specific signals and outliers are considered; some of them are illustrated using computer experiments.},

  abstract       = {In singular spectrum analysis, which is applied to signal extraction, it is of critical importance to select the number of components correctly in order to accurately estimate the signal. In the case of a low-rank signal, there is a challenge in estimating the signal rank, which is equivalent to selecting the model order. Information criteria are commonly employed to address these issues. However, singular spectrum analysis is not aimed at the exact low-rank approximation of the signal. This makes it an adaptive, fast, and flexible approach. Conventional information criteria are not directly applicable in this context. The paper examines both subspace-based and information criteria, proposing modifications suited to the Hankel structure of trajectory matrices employed in singular spectrum analysis. These modifications are initially developed for white noise, and a version for red noise is also proposed. In the numerical comparisons, a number of scenarios are considered, including the case of signals that are approximated by low-rank signals. This is the most similar to the case of real-world time series. The criteria are compared with each other and with the optimal rank choice that minimizes the signal estimation error. The results of numerical experiments demonstrate that for low-rank signals and noise levels within a region of stable rank detection, the proposed modifications yield accurate estimates of the optimal rank for both white and red noise cases. The method that considers the Hankel structure of the trajectory matrices appears to be a superior approach in many instances. Reasonable model orders are obtained for real-world time series. It is recommended that a transformation be applied to stabilize the variance before estimating the rank.},

  abstract      = {Singular spectrum analysis is a powerful and widely used non-parametric method to analyse and forecast time series. Although singular spectrum analysis has proven to outperform traditional parametric methods for model fit and model forecasting, one of the steps of this algorithm is the singular value decomposition of the trajectory matrix, which is very sensitive to the presence of outliers because it uses the $$L_{2}$$norm optimization. Therefore the presence of outlying observations have a significant impact on the singular spectrum analysis reconstruction and forecasts. The main aim of this paper is to introduce four robust alternatives to the singular spectrum analysis, where the singular value decomposition is replaced by the: (i) robust regularized singular value decomposition; (ii) robust principal component analysis algorithm, which combines projection pursuit ideas with robust scatter matrix estimation; (iii) robust principal component analysis based on the grid algorithm and projection pursuit; and (iv) robust principal component analysis based on a robust covariance matrix. The four proposed robust singular spectrum analysis alternatives are compared with the classical singular spectrum analysis and other available robust singular spectrum analysis algorithms, in terms of model fit and model forecasting via Monte Carlo simulations based on synthetic and real data, considering several contamination scenarios.},

  abstract  = { Several rank-reduction techniques have been proposed to simultaneously denoise and reconstruct seismic datasets. We reformulate the Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) filter as a convex optimization problem constraining the associated Hankel matrix to be of low-rank. The Hankel matrix is written as the product of two matrices of lower dimension, which are obtained using a gradient descent algorithm, called the bifactored gradient descent (BFGD). The BFGD is an efficient nonconvex method which can be easily adaptable to include sampling operators within robust measures as cost functions, thus simultaneously handling missing traces and erratic noise. We evaluate the BFGD-based SSA in the simultaneous reconstruction and denoising of a 3D field dataset and compare it with the MSSA interpolation method. The results support that the BFGD does have a competitive performance for seismic data processing applications.Presentation Date: Monday, September 16, 2019Session Start Time: 1:50 PMPresentation Start Time: 3:05 PMLocation: Poster Station 13Presentation Type: Poster },

In this paper, we consider the SSA technique based on the perturbation theory and examine its performance in both reconstructing and forecasting noisy series. We also consider the sensitivity of the technique to different window lengths, noise levels and series lengths. To cover a broad application range, various simulated series, from dynamic to chaotic, are used to verify the proposed algorithm. We then evaluate the performance of the technique using two real well-known series, namely, monthly accidental deaths in the USA, and the daily closing prices of several stock market indices. The results are compared with several classical methods namely, Box–Jenkins SARIMA models, the ARAR algorithm, GARCH model and the Holt–Winter algorithm.},
